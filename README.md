                    ##########    WHAT IS THIS CODE ABOUT ?   ##########   

This code is based on the data of Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project (ACLED)
ACLED is a website that gathers all the conflict events from 1997 till today with all the 
details (Event Type, Actors, Fatalities, etc..) that belong to these events.
Through this code, we are going to create a dashboard that will allow the user 
to display more clearly this data by choosing simultaneously:
- the view: either a MAP or a GRAPHIC view
- and the filters: the range of YEARS, the EVENT TYPE, the EVENT  REGION, and the ACTOR TYPE.
This is done, by showing the FATALITIES and EVENT COUNTS.

              
              ##########   WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROJECT?  ##########

This project can be used by :
- Investors with business purposes looking for stable environments by reffering to historical data
- Non-profit organisations by providing them an outlook of the places in need for help (medical,education..)
- News agencies/Researches looking for patterns of crisis and conflict around the world
- Normal users/Curious people just wanting to discover and learn

The deployed dashboard can be found on this link:  https://hajjar.shinyapps.io/ACLED-dashboard/
